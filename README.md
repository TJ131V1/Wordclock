**This repository contains all the files for my custom word clock project, inspired by QLOCKTWO EARTH 45.**
The clock is a fully functional, physical word-based timepiece built from scratch and controlled by an Arduino Nano. In addition to telling the time, it includes several extra features such as:

Classic games like Snake and Tetris

Scrolling custom text

LED visual effects including Conway’s Game of Life, Matrix rain, and a random letter decay animation

The repository includes:

**Arduino Code** – All source code for the microcontroller

**KiCAD Files** – Complete circuit schematic and PCB layout

**2D Cutting Files** – Laser-cut design files for the structural components
