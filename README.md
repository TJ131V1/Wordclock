## 💡 Project Description

**This repository contains all the files for my custom word clock project, inspired by QLOCKTWO EARTH 45.**
The clock is a fully functional, physical word-based timepiece built from scratch and controlled by an Arduino Nano. It includes four hidden capacitive touch sensors. In addition to telling the time, it features:

- Snake game

- Tetris game

- LED visual effects including custom scrolling text, Conway’s Game of Life, Matrix rain, and a random letter decay animation

The repository includes:

- **Arduino Code** – All source code for the microcontroller

- **KiCAD Files** – Complete circuit schematic and PCB layout

- **2D Cutting Files** – Laser-cut design files for the structural components

- **Technical Report** – In-depth 10-page report detailing the project design, implementation, and build process
