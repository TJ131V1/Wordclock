This repository contains files for my personal wordclock project, inspired by QLOCKTWO. 
The project is a physical wordclock made from scratch, controlled by an arduino nano; this repository contains the arduino code, KiCAD files, and 2D cutting files I used in this project.

The schematic and PCB files can be found under 'KiCAD Files'.
